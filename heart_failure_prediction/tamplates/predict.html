                The force of circulating blood on the walls of the arteries or blood pressure is the measurement of pressure of the blood in your arteries, which are vessels that carry your blood from your heart to the rest of your body. Blood pressure is taken using two measurements: systolic (measured when the heart beats, when blood pressure is at its highest) and diastolic (measured between heart beats, when blood pressure is at its lowest). Blood pressure is written with the systolic blood pressure first, followed by the diastolic blood pressure (for example 120/80).

                Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that's found in all the cells in your body. Your body needs some cholesterol to work properly. But if you have too much of it in your blood, it can stick to the walls of your arteries and narrow or even block them. This puts you at risk of coronary artery disease and other heart diseases.

                Blood sugar level, also known as blood glucose level, refers to the amount of glucose, a type of sugar, in your blood. Glucose is your body's primary source of energy, derived from the food you eat. Blood sugar levels fluctuate throughout the day and are generally higher after eating and lower when fasting. Normal blood sugar levels generally range from 4.0 to 7.8 mmol/L (72 to 140 mg/dL) for individuals without diabetes.

            <p>
                The heart rate measures the number of times per minute that the heart contracts or beats. Most adults have a target resting heart rate of 60 to 100 beats per minute. A heart rate exceeding 100 bpm at rest is considered high.
